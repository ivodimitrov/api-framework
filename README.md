# api-framework

An automated API / web service / integration testing framework

The framework using the following:

- [Allure Report](https://qameta.io/allure-report/) - A flexible lightweight test report tool.
- [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker) - A library for generating fake data such as names, addresses, and phone numbers.
- [Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry) - A runtime developer console.
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - A popular language with testers.
- [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/) - Allows us to create tasks to manage dependencies and run our checks.
- [Rspec](https://rspec.info/) - Framework to create and organise our checks.
- [Rest-client](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client) - Builds and triggers HTTP requests whilst handling responses to be used in our checks.

The framework contains three areas:

<ul>
<li>Tests - Surprisingly where the tests themselves are stored. The tests will call functions from the API and Payload areas of the framework and be responsible for asserting responses.</li>
<li>API - All of the HTTP requests that you want to make are stored here. They are grouped based on the resource you are calling so if there are two resources called Booking and Auth then we create two classes named Booking and Auth. Each function is tied to an individual request that can be called multiple times. This means if the request changes it requires a single change to propagate through the framework.</li>
<li>Payloads - Payloads that are required for requests and responses are stored in this area. The idea is similar to the API area in that one class is responsible for one payload that may be called multiple times. Again, this means if the payload changes it requires a single change to propagate through the framework.</li>
</ul>

## Tests

Suite of automated checks against the web service [https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/)

## Setup

Run `bundle install` to install all the dependencies.

## Executing tests

To start tests, run: `bundle exec rake`

## Generating local HTML Allure report

To generate the report from existing Allure results you can use the following command:

```shell
allure generate report/allure-results --clean
```

When the report is generated you can open it in your default system browser. Simply run:

```shell
allure open allure-report
```

## What is the builder pattern?
[@FriendlyTester](https://twitter.com/friendlytester) has a [great blog post on what the builder pattern](http://www.thefriendlytester.co.uk/2015/06/an-introduction-to-data-builder-pattern.html) is and itâ€™s context to data creation.
