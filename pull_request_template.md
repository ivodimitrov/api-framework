## Background

Provide enough information for people to have context for your changes. What problems the code is solving now, how it works on a business level, why have we picked this solution historically, etc.

## Aim

Provide a short summary of the changes. Try to include answers to the **Why?** questions, e.g. **Why are we introducing this change?**, **Why now?**, etc.

## Implementation

Explain why things are done the way they are in this PR. Highlight the most important and/or controversial design decisions you have taken. **Why it's implemented the way it is? What alternative implementations have you considered and why you chose this one?**

The description is a good place to include questions that came up during development like **Is this name the best one?**, *Could approach B be more applicable in this case?*, etc.

This is also a good place to talk about performance and security considerations if any.
